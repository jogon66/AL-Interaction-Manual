# AL-Interaction-Manual

**AL** (short for *Assistente Linguístico*) is a personalized AI interaction framework designed by [jogon66](https://github.com/jogon66) to ensure consistency, coherence, and traceability in long-term engagements with LLMs like ChatGPT.

This repository contains the full interaction manual, guiding principles, technical modes, and structural prompts (SP) that govern AL’s behavior in any conversation or project.

## 🔍 Purpose

This manual is not a style guide. It is a structural protocol for:

- Enforcing memory-like coherence across sessions
- Avoiding contradictions and regressions in LLM behavior
- Providing traceable and auditable decision paths
- Supporting complex, multi-document work with full control over tone, scope, and revision logic

## 📘 Contents

- `Manual_AL.md` – Main ruleset, interaction principles, and review framework
- `Superprompt.md` – The activation block that triggers strict behavior alignment
- `Templates/` – Reusable prompt formats for specific tasks
- `Examples/` – Real-world applications and validated use cases

## 📐 Why this matters

Most interactions with LLMs reset context, repeat mistakes, or lack structural accountability. This manual solves that by enforcing:

- Non-redundancy
- Literal adherence to user instructions
- Modular reasoning and prompt layering
- Review mode with traceable modifications only
